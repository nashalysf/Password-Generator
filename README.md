# Password-Generator
A random-password generator to practice and control JavaScript.

## Made with:
* A given html
* A given css
* JavaScript

## Purpose and Features:
* The purpose of this code is to practice and understand js in order to control it and define its behavior.
* It creates a random set of characters based on the user preferences.
* If the user preferences doesn't meet js minimun preferences to generate it alerts user.

### Preferences include:
* Numbers
* Symbols
* Uppercase
* Lowercase
* Length (with a min. of 8 characters and a max. of 128 characters)
* This conditions are selected by a checkbox which comes with default preferences (checked) because it's easier to uncheck a set amount than check every last box if user wants all conditions.

### Steps:
* The conditions were specified directly in the js (not inherited form web or other).
* Js was told how to use the conditions along the selected amount of characters.
* Js was told how to 'see' if the condition of the user are met with the algorithm.
* It generates a code with a randomizer funtion and it displays on the box.
